    "The Functional API is useful when you want to build a model with more complex (non-linear) topologies, including multiple inputs, multiple outputs, residual connections with non-sequential flows, and shared and reusable layers. Each layer is callable (with a tensor in input), and each layer returns a tensor as an output. Let's look at an example where we have two separate inputs, two separate logistic regressions as outputs, and one shared module in the middle."

    "Model subclassing offers the highest flexibility and it is generally used when you need to define your own layer. In other words, it is useful when you are in the business of building your own special lego brick instead of composing more standard and well-known bricks. There is indeed a higher cost in terms of complexity and therefore subclassing should be used only when really needed. In the majority of situations, Sequential and Functional APIs are more appropriate, but you can still use model subclassing if you prefer to think in an object-oriented manner, as the typical Python/NumPy developer does."
